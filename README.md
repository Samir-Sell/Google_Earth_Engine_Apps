GEE Apps that were created to perform basic remote sensing operations using no code. 

Band Math App: Allows users to perform any type of band math on a variety of predetermined images. A number of prebuilt band math equations are built into the applications. 

Quality Mosaic App: Allows users to generate their own quality mosaics based on a given date, band or index and a user drawn polygon. 

Sensor App: Allows users to play around with different satellites, different bands, cloud thresholds, locations, dates and generate band histograms. 

Supervised Classification App: Allows users to perform a Smile Random Forest pixel based classification on an area of interest that the user has chosen. Additionally, the user has the option to choose 1 to 6 landclasses and choose which band / indices will be used in the classsification.
